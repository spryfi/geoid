Replit Prompt: Implement 2D "Explore Nearby" Map (Expo Go Compatible)

Objective: Implement the "Explore Nearby" screen using the existing react-native-maps library to ensure it works perfectly in Expo Go. The focus is on creating a functional and informative 2D map that highlights the Balcones Escarpment and nearby geological Points of Interest (POIs).

Constraint: You MUST use the existing react-native-maps library. Do NOT add @rnmapbox/maps or any other library that requires a custom development build. The solution must be 100% compatible with Expo Go.

1. Map Setup and Initial View

•
Component: Use the <MapView> component from react-native-maps.

•
Initial Region: Center the map on Buda, TX (latitude: 30.08, longitude: -97.84) with a reasonable zoom level to show the surrounding area (latitudeDelta: 0.2, longitudeDelta: 0.2).

•
Map Style: Use a hybrid or satellite map style for better terrain visualization.

•
Camera Pitch: If possible, apply a slight camera pitch to give a sense of perspective. Use the camera prop or animateCamera method with pitch: 45.

2. The Balcones Escarpment Polyline

This is the primary geological feature for this location. It must be clearly visible.

•
Component: Use the <Polyline> component.

•
Data: Use a mock array of coordinates that traces the escarpment north-to-south through the Austin/Buda area.

•
Styling: Make the line stand out. Use a bright orange color (#FFA500) and a strokeWidth of at least 4.

JavaScript


// data/balcones.js
const balconesEscarpmentTrace = [
  { latitude: 30.28, longitude: -97.76 },
  { latitude: 30.15, longitude: -97.79 },
  { latitude: 30.05, longitude: -97.80 }, // Near Buda
  { latitude: 29.95, longitude: -97.82 },
];

// In the component
<Polyline
  coordinates={balconesEscarpmentTrace}
  strokeColor="#FFA500"
  strokeWidth={4}
/>


3. Points of Interest (POIs)

Display tappable markers for interesting geological sites.

•
Component: Use the <Marker> component.

•
Data: Create a mock data array for at least 3-4 POIs relevant to the Buda area. Each POI object should have an id, name, type (e.g., 'Rock Outcrop', 'Fossil Site'), coordinate, and a short description.

•
Custom Icons: Create simple custom markers. You can use a <View> with custom styling and an icon inside (e.g., from react-native-vector-icons) to differentiate between POI types.

JavaScript


// data/pois.js
const nearbyPois = [
  {
    id: 1, name: 'Austin Chalk Outcrop',
    type: 'Rock Outcrop',
    coordinate: { latitude: 30.10, longitude: -97.81 },
    description: 'A road cut revealing the Austin Chalk, a Cretaceous-age limestone famous for its fossils.'
  },
  {
    id: 2, name: 'Onion Creek Fossil Bed',
    type: 'Fossil Site',
    coordinate: { latitude: 30.12, longitude: -97.75 },
    description: 'Known for Exogyra ponderosa fossils, a type of large oyster from the late Cretaceous period.'
  }
];


4. Interactive Info Cards

When a user taps a POI marker, display an information card at the bottom of the screen.

•
State Management: Use a useState hook (selectedPoi) to keep track of which marker is currently selected.

•
Marker onPress: Each <Marker> should have an onPress event that sets the selectedPoi state to that marker's data.

•
Card Component: Conditionally render an information card overlay at the bottom of the screen only when selectedPoi is not null. This card should display the POI's name, type, description, and a button for "Directions".

•
Deselection: Tapping the map or a close button on the card should set selectedPoi back to null, hiding the card.

Final Quick Prompt for Replit


"Using only the react-native-maps library, implement the 2D 'Explore Nearby' screen. Center the map on Buda, TX, and use a satellite or hybrid style. Draw the Balcones Escarpment as a thick, orange <Polyline>. Add several tappable <Marker>s for local geological Points of Interest like the 'Austin Chalk Outcrop' and 'Onion Creek Fossil Bed', using simple custom icons to differentiate them. When a marker is tapped, display an information card at the bottom of the screen with the POI's details. Ensure this works in Expo Go."
