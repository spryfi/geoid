Remove the current hardcoded Balcones Escarpment line. Replace all geological feature data with real data from these APIs:
For fault lines: Query the USGS Quaternary Faults ArcGIS REST service at https://earthquake.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/haz/Qfaults/MapServer/21/query with parameters: where=1%3D1, geometry={user viewport bounding box}, geometryType=esriGeometryEnvelope, inSR=4326, outSR=4326, outFields=fault_name,age,fault_type,dip_direction,slip_rate,symbology,fault_url, f=geojson. Render each fault as a react-native-maps Polyline using the actual GeoJSON coordinates (these are real multi-vertex polylines, NOT 2-point straight lines). Color-code by the symbology field age classification.
For the Balcones Fault Zone specifically (which is too old for the Quaternary database): Query the Texas Geologic Database at https://feature.tnris.org/arcgis/rest/services/Geologic_Database/GeologicDatabaseofTexas/MapServer for fault line layers with a bounding box around Central Texas. This has the BEG's digitized fault traces.
For geological points of interest: Query Macrostrat at https://macrostrat.org/api/v2/geologic_units/map?lat={lat}&lng={lng}&format=geojson_bare to get the geological unit at any location (formation name, rock type, age, lithology). Use https://macrostrat.org/api/v2/fossils for fossil collection sites. These become the map markers categorized as Fossil Site, Mineral Deposit, Geological Landmark, etc.
Architecture: Create a GeologyDataService module that fetches from these APIs based on the current map viewport. Cache results so we don't re-fetch when panning slightly. Render fault polylines as thin semi-transparent lines (2-3px, using appropriate geological color conventions), NOT thick bold lines. Show POI markers with the existing icon categories from the mockup.
Do NOT hardcode any coordinates for geological features. All data must come from these APIs.

The key insight for the agent is that the USGS ArcGIS endpoint returns real polylines with dozens of vertices — the fault traces follow the actual geological mapping at 1:250,000 scale. That's what makes them look like real contour-following fault lines instead of the crude straight line it's drawing now.
