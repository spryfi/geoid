Replit Prompt: Implement AI-Powered Field Debugger v2

Objective: To upgrade the Field Debugger into an interactive, AI-powered tool that allows users to visually annotate issues and automatically generate high-quality Replit prompts for on-the-spot fixes.




1. Screen Annotation Canvas

•
Trigger: After the user shakes the device to open the debug modal, the captured screenshot should be displayed.

•
Implementation: Overlay a drawing canvas directly on top of the screenshot. Use a library like react-native-sketch-canvas or react-native-draw-on-screen.

•
UI:

•
Provide simple drawing tools: a red pen tool and an undo button.

•
The user can now circle, underline, or draw arrows on the screenshot to pinpoint the exact problem.



2. AI-Powered Prompt Generation

This is the core of the new feature. The workflow is as follows:

1.
User Action: The user annotates the screenshot and fills in the "What went wrong?" text field with a simple description (e.g., "this text is cut off").

2.
New Button: Add a new primary button labeled "Generate Replit Prompt".

3.
API Call: When this button is tapped, make an API call to a powerful vision-capable AI model (e.g., GPT-4 Vision).

4.
Payload: The API call must send a multi-modal payload:

•
The annotated screenshot (as a base64 encoded image).

•
The user's raw text from the "What went wrong?" field.

•
The structured debug data (GPS, device info, action log).



5.
Meta-Prompt for the AI: The prompt sent to the AI model should be carefully engineered to produce the desired output. Use the following meta-prompt:


"You are an expert React Native developer tasked with writing a bug fix prompt for another developer. Based on the provided annotated screenshot, user notes, and technical debug data, generate a concise, actionable Replit prompt in Markdown. The prompt should clearly identify the problem and suggest a specific code-level solution. Start with a one-sentence summary of the issue. Be direct and specific in your suggested fix."



3. Results Display and Delivery

1.
Display Card: After the AI model responds, display the generated Replit prompt in a clean, read-only card within the modal. The card should have a title: "Generated Replit Prompt".

2.
Delivery Options: Below the card, provide two buttons:

•
"Copy to Clipboard": A simple button that copies the entire generated prompt text.

•
"Send to my Phone (SMS)": A button that triggers an SMS to be sent to the user's registered phone number.



3.
SMS Integration:

•
Backend: This requires a backend service to handle the SMS sending.

•
Service: Integrate with an SMS provider like Twilio.

•
Flow: The app sends the generated prompt text to your backend, which then makes the API call to Twilio to send the SMS.






Quick Copy-Paste for Replit


"Upgrade the Field Debugger. (1) After the shake gesture, allow the user to draw on the screenshot using a library like react-native-sketch-canvas. (2) Add a 'Generate Replit Prompt' button. On tap, send the annotated screenshot, user notes, and debug data to a GPT-4 Vision endpoint with a meta-prompt that asks it to generate a developer-ready bug fix prompt. (3) Display the AI-generated prompt in a card with 'Copy to Clipboard' and 'Send via SMS' buttons. Integrate with Twilio for the SMS functionality."
