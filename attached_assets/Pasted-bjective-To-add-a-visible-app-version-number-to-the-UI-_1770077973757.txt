bjective: To add a visible app version number to the UI and wire it up so that tapping it 7 times enables a hidden "Field Debug Mode". This is the entry point for the Smart Field Debugger feature.




1. Display the App Version Number

•
Location: This should be placed in a logical, non-intrusive spot. The best location is at the bottom of the Settings screen.

•
Source: The version number should be read dynamically from the expo.version field in your app.json file. Do not hardcode it.

•
Implementation:

JavaScript


import Constants from 'expo-constants';

const appVersion = Constants.expoConfig.version;

// In your Settings screen component:
<Text style={{ color: 'gray', textAlign: 'center', padding: 20 }}>
  Version: {appVersion}
</Text>





2. Implement Hidden Tap Gesture Activation

•
Goal: To create a hidden "Easter egg" style activation for the debug mode.

•
Component: Wrap the <Text> component that displays the version number in a <TouchableOpacity> or similar tappable component.

•
Logic:

1.
Create a state variable to count taps, e.g., const [tapCount, setTapCount] = useState(0);

2.
Create a state variable to track if debug mode is active, e.g., const [isDebugMode, setIsDebugMode] = useDebugState(); (this should be a global state using Zustand or Context so other parts of the app can access it).

3.
On each tap of the version number, increment tapCount.

4.
When tapCount reaches 7, set isDebugMode to true.

5.
Show a confirmation message, like a Toast: "Field Debug Mode Activated!"

6.
Reset the tapCount to 0 after activation.

7.
If the user taps again after activation, show a toast: "Debug Mode is already active."



3. Persist Debug State

•
Goal: The debug mode setting should persist even if the app is closed and reopened.

•
Implementation: Use AsyncStorage to save the isDebugMode state. When the app starts, read from AsyncStorage to initialize the debug state.




Quick Copy-Paste for Replit


"Please add the app version number to the bottom of the Settings screen, reading it dynamically from app.json. Wrap this version number in a TouchableOpacity and implement a hidden activation for debug mode: when the user taps it 7 times, set a global isDebugMode state to true (persisted in AsyncStorage) and show a 'Field Debug Mode Activated!' toast message. This is the entry point for the Smart Field Debugger."
